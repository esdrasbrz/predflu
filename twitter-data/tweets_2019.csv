2019-06-09T00:22:38Z,"@LABJ23 @IcySimmons This provides zero evidence that the flu he caught was caused by his diet. He eats like shit. I get it. But to say the flu and respiratory illness he caught during the series was caused by his diet, that is a faulty assumption."
2019-06-09T00:06:56Z,@LABJ23 @IcySimmons We both know you’re bullshitting. It was a stomach flu not food poisoning
2019-06-08T19:19:24Z,"@RackItUpDannyG I’m not saying Gasol didn’t do a great job on him, but he was definitely sick for game 4 and I don’t understand why I got raps fans in my mentions getting pissed at me for suggesting the Sixers might’ve won that game if Embiid didn’t have the flu lol https://t.co/hAXpiFUfNc"
2019-06-08T22:30:54Z,@LABJ23 @IcySimmons You don’t think Embiid not having the flu would’ve made no difference in a 5 point loss?
2019-06-09T02:35:56Z,"@LABJ23 @IcySimmons Holy sweet flying fuck. This isn’t about Gasol’s ability to play good D on Embiid. This is about Embiid being sick. And when you’re sick with the flu, you PROBABLY aren’t going to play to your potential. How is this so hard to admit?"
2019-06-08T22:58:12Z,"@LABJ23 @IcySimmons Was there actually a report Embiid got sick because of something he ate? I don’t remember seeing that. Typically when people get the flu, it has nothing to do with what you eat lol"
2019-06-08T19:20:12Z,"@MJama22 True or false, Embiid had the flu before game 4?"
2019-06-09T02:40:58Z,@LABJ23 @IcySimmons Lol I hope you get a stomach flu so you can understand
2019-06-09T03:59:39Z,"@Joevar_A @LABJ23 @IcySimmons I never said he would’ve dominated Gasol 🤦‍♂️. Raps won game 4 by a hair. If Embiid was a tiny bit better, they could’ve won and taken a 3-1 lead. I think it’s safe to say if he wasn’t suffering from the flu, he could’ve been a tiny bit better, and that would’ve been the difference"
2019-06-08T19:36:01Z,@416Hogtown @RackItUpDannyG There’s nothing wrong with pointing out how good the Sixers played us and how we caught a break with Embiid getting the flu. Ya’ll need to relax lol
2019-06-08T22:28:20Z,@LABJ23 @IcySimmons Holy fuck I’m fully acknowledging how good a job Gasol did on Embiid. I’m saying Embiid being sick obviously made him less effective. Or least I’m assuming lol. You guys seem to think having the flu is irrelevant to his performance
2019-06-09T00:15:16Z,"@LABJ23 @IcySimmons The first article is from 4 years ago, as they call him a 21 year old and he’s 25 now. The 2nd one says right in the title “nba rumors”, doesn’t say the flu he caught was from his diet. All depends what he actually had. If he had gastro, it’s not caused by diet."
2019-06-09T02:15:38Z,"@LABJ23 @IcySimmons In a game as close as game 4 was, a healthy Embiid scoring an extra basket or 2 could’ve been the difference. If Philly goes up 3-1 it’s a totally different series. It was that close. It’s ridiculous to suggest not having the flu would’ve make zero difference"
